Multiple Timezone Simple Analog Clock Using HTML , CSS And Javascript


This clock was created entirely with CSS. There were no images used. We created it using the most fundamental concept, which is easily understood by beginners.

The pageâ€™s structure was created with HTML and CSS, and the automatic time is retrieved with JavaScript.

The clock will change auto background color on early morning, daytime, evening time and nighttime.
